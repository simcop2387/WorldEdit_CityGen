Added FIRSTTIME argument to allow kicking off a new city
Tightened up the origin street crossing validation to prevent rifts
Pilings should be under the entire city block
Mushrooms in the plumbing are no longer floating! Woot! ...well for the most part
Place buildings on stilts (pylons) if there isn't a basement
0, 1 or 2 basement levels
2 level basement should replace parts (or all of the plumbing)
Parking structures with basements but no upper floors have goofed up center lines
Entrances to parking structures are goofed up
Plumbing is now a bit taller and more complicated
Bugs related to taller sewers (parking basement for example)
Look to the NW (or SW or SE or NE) and that is where things get created
Reworked the origin logic, now you just need to stand where streets come together
"Round" out the upper corners in the sewers
Moved the origin spot again, now on the light gray crosswalk strip nearest to the manhole
Add bricked up doors in the sewers, empty ones in the case where there is nothing in "cell"
Made the sewer a bit taller 
Touchup the parking ramp creation to fix the ceiling indent on the last step
In smaller parks, have one big tree instead of a fountian
Above ground parking garage
Paint lines in the parking lot
Redid the park manhole and endcaps for fences
Moved and improved the manholes to sewer, cisturn and plumbing
Move the build point to the point just in front of the streetlamp, beside the manhole
Cleaned up some of the random usage
House now have attics (access to them is left to the player)
Buildings on stilts (lots of columns around a core at first and then a normal city building on top)
Center stairwells in buildings
Building with rounded corners... sorta still feels like it needs more work... hummm
HIGHRISE - buildings as tall as can be, no parks
MIDRISE - 2/3 as tall as can be, optional single 1x park
LOWRISE - 1/3 as tall as can be, optional single 1x park
TOWN - 1/4 as tall as can be, plus optional single 2x park
HOUSES builds a two by two neighborhood of houses
FARMHOUSE now builds a farm with a single house
RANDOM overrides the consistent random city blocks and produces really random city blocks
Now builds the exact same city block when you rebuilt at the same location (stand on the manhole)
Farms with wheat, suger cane, cactus, rose, dandelion, trees, pumpkins and empty plots
No random buildings in buildings
Trees in parks!
Fixed the spelling of JUSTSTEETS
Optimized transcription a bit (around 10% faster, on average) by getting before setting
Refactored the building/park resize and placement logic
Rework the building material logics (more colored cloth, less fire proof)
Doors for the buildings
Regular (and existing random) windows in buildings
Add street lines
Door and ladder fixup logic working
Place manholes for plumbing
Ladders down to reservoirs and sewers
Renamed emptylot to dirtlot
Placed manholes in parks
Arg options for emptylots, parks, parkinglots, streetsonly, towns (short) and cities (tall)
Add some lights to the reservoirs
Remove all doors and ladders for now, not really a fix more of an avoiding
Wooden floors with accent only in building's walls
Parks with cisturns (underground water reservoirs) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistern
Skylights on roofs, well some of them anyway
Support 3x3, 3x2, 2x3, 3x1, 1x3, 2x2, 2x1 and 1x2 buildings
Pyramid, needle or tented roofs for buildings
Simple park with fountain
Stairwells in basement 
Add guardrails to stairs
Thicker streets (allows for roadlines and manholes)

Get rid of the "make a region first" requirement
Sewer treasure encroaches onto the plumbing level
Need to narrow the sidewalks 
Add sandstone accent for wood structures 
Stairs (down into the basement, up to roof when doable) 
Streetlights 
Manholes w/ladders down to the sewer (be the "focal" point)
